Perfect — here are **~1 minute 30 seconds for *each major section***. They’re paced for clear speaking, natural pauses, and live demo moments. You can trim or stretch slightly depending on your speed.

## **1. INTRODUCTION & LOGIN (1 min 30 sec)**

**“Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today, I’m proud to present *Sneha*, a mental wellness platform designed to support users through AI-powered assistance, community connection, and personalized wellness resources.**

Mental health support should be accessible, safe, and stigma-free, and that’s the core idea behind Sneha.

Let me begin with the login experience.

As soon as users arrive, they’re welcomed by a calm, purple-themed interface designed to promote relaxation and emotional safety. The dark, premium design helps users feel comfortable, especially during vulnerable moments.

Sneha offers a simple and secure authentication process. Users can log in with existing credentials or create a new account in just a few steps. Behind the scenes, all passwords are securely encrypted using industry-standard bcrypt technology.

Let me log in using our demo account.

And just like that, we’re authenticated and ready to explore Sneha. From the very first interaction, the platform focuses on trust, security, and emotional comfort.”**

## **2. DASHBOARD (1 min 30 sec)**

**“This is the Sneha Dashboard — the central hub of the user’s mental wellness journey.

At the top, users see a personalized greeting, which immediately creates a sense of connection and belonging. This small detail helps users feel seen and welcomed.

One of the most important features here is Mood Tracking. Users can quickly log how they’re feeling, and over time this data is visualized into charts that reveal emotional patterns, trends, and potential triggers.

The dashboard also displays quick statistics such as days active, wellness activities completed, community participation, and AI support sessions. These insights help users stay motivated and aware of their progress.

Below that, recent activity keeps users engaged by reminding them of their wellness journey.

Finally, quick action buttons allow users to instantly start an AI chat, log a mood, explore wellness content, or enter the community.

The dashboard isn’t just informative — it actively guides users toward support when they need it most.”**

## **3. WELLNESS LIBRARY (1 min 30 sec)**

**“Mental wellness requires the right tools, and that’s where the Wellness Library comes in.

This section offers a curated collection of guided meditations, mindfulness exercises, stress-relief sessions, and sleep-focused content. Each meditation includes professional guidance, calming audio, and flexible durations to suit any schedule.

In addition, Sneha provides healing music such as binaural beats, ambient soundscapes, and nature-inspired audio designed to help users relax, focus, or sleep better.

The user interface is designed to feel premium and soothing, with custom imagery, smooth animations, and intuitive playback controls. Users can pause, resume, and track their progress at any time.

When content is selected, a full media player opens with volume control, progress tracking, and related recommendations.

The Wellness Library is continuously updated based on user feedback and mental health research, ensuring content remains relevant and effective.”**

## **4. COMMUNITY (1 min 30 sec)**

**“Mental health journeys are easier when shared, and that’s why Sneha includes a supportive community feature.

This is a safe, moderated space where users can share experiences, express feelings, celebrate small victories, or ask for advice. Users can choose to post publicly or anonymously, giving them full control over their comfort level.

Each post allows others to like, comment, and show support, creating a positive and encouraging environment.

Safety is a top priority. Sneha uses AI-powered moderation to flag harmful or concerning content, which is then reviewed by human moderators. Clear community guidelines and reporting tools help maintain a respectful space.

The community is organized into categories such as daily check-ins, coping strategies, success stories, and peer support.

This isn’t just a forum — it’s a compassionate space where people feel understood and supported.”**

## **5. AI SUPPORT (1 min 30 sec)**

**“Sometimes, users need immediate support — late at night, during stress, or when they’re not ready to talk to someone. That’s where Sneha’s AI Support comes in.

Powered by Google’s Gemini AI and fine-tuned for mental wellness, the AI provides empathetic, non-judgmental conversations. It helps users manage anxiety, stress, and overwhelming emotions through practical coping strategies and guided exercises.

For example, if a user says they’re feeling anxious, the AI responds with validation, calming techniques, and helpful suggestions, while asking thoughtful follow-up questions.

The AI is available 24/7, ensuring support is always accessible. Conversations are private and encrypted, and users can revisit past chats to track progress.

Importantly, Sneha is transparent — the AI is not a replacement for therapy. In crisis situations, it recognizes warning signs and immediately provides emergency resources and encourages professional help.”**

## **6. PROFILE & SETTINGS (1 min 30 sec)**

**“Finally, the Profile section allows users to personalize and control their experience.

Here, users can manage personal details such as profile information, pronouns, and time zone. Privacy and security settings allow them to control who sees their content, manage passwords, and enable additional security options.

Users can customize notifications, themes, accessibility features, and language preferences to suit their needs.

The profile also helps users set wellness goals, such as daily meditation targets, mood logging streaks, and self-care reminders.

In addition, users can view detailed insights into their mood history, content usage, and community activity, and even download their data if needed.

Sneha gives users full control — including the ability to pause or permanently delete their account at any time.”**
